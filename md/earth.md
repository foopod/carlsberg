#Earth

####This green and blue planet has supported carbon based life for millions of years. Very few planets are this habitable, the atmosphere and climate are lenient and existing species welcoming.

Unfortunately the planet isn't very developed, no intergalactic outpost in this system at all actually. Glad I stocked up first overwise I might have had call planetside assistance.

Biggest fucking lizards I have ever seen though. I guess the planet has been going through a lot of changes though, they certainly didn't seem like the optimal lifeforms to be dealing with that snow and ice.
