Canyon's ownership has passed hands a bunch of times. And now lies in the hands of a philanthropist that is researching early planet creationism.

####Canyon is an artificially made planet, it was created after the ATR3 (Advanced Troglodyte Race 3) first watched the Star Wars prequels. The species spent many years building Pod Racers, only to find that they didn't have enough room to race them in their cave systems. Being one of the more advanced Troglodyte species they constructed Canyon, a smallish planet dedicated to pod racing. Unfortunately the sport never really caught on anywhere in the galaxy and the planet was abandoned after a few decades.
