####When human's first discovered inter-system travel Sentri was their primary target. It has both a green surface and a relatively high density, they had hoped for life. But they got one better, a planet whose core was solid plutonium. For early human travellers this was the 'bees knees' as the majority of their stone age energy systems relied on Nuclear Fission.

####Within a century the mining operation had seen more that one third the plutonium stripped from the planets core. With the density shift, the planets orbit changed over the years and has got an estimated 30,000 cycles before plunging into Alpha Centauri B.
