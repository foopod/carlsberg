A game.

Saw a cool low res effect on a 3D browser game and wanted to use it. Made a planet for another game maybe a year ago now. Decided to see what it would look like and the results were quite pleasing.

So this is a space exploration/adventure narrative driven game using that model and a few others I whipped up today.
