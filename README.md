#Carlsberg

A game.

Saw a cool low res effect on a 3D browser game and wanted to use it. Made a planet for another game maybe a year ago now. Decided to see what it would look like and the results were quite pleasing.

So this is a space exploration/adventure narrative driven game using that model and a few others I whipped up today.

Current Version can be viewed [here](http://carlsberg.jono.tech/).

#Narrative Ideas

* Traverse the universe chasing the elusive Carlsberg, an advanced cybernetic secret agent. They have gone rogue and our mission is to recover the intelligence he has stolen by any means necessary. Uncover clues, solve problems and navigate tricky situations to track them down. Learn more about intergalactic law enforcement agency (ILEA), how they operate and the story that led to Carlsbergs creation.

* The diary of an explorer by the name of Carlsberg, read the entries they write for each planets and hear about their experiences as they discover the secrets of the universe. Decipher Carlsberg's entries to find new planets they have visited. The universe is not as big as you think.

#Gameplay Ideas

* Decipher hidden codes that give you coordinates to a new location, enter them to uncover new planets.
